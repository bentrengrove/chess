# Chess
A Chess game written with Jetpack Compose.

Ported from [https://github.com/nicklockwood/Chess](https://github.com/nicklockwood/Chess).

Work In Progress

I use this project as a experimentation and learning environment. The code is by no means meant as an example of good clean code.
If anything it is the opposite.

## TODO
- Animating pieces
- Better AI (the current one is really terrible, effectively random)
